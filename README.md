# housing-finder

WORK IN PROGRESS 

This is a website meant to help students in the Netherlands find housing by scraping data from the housing website Pararius, and filtering the housing offers to only include offers that allow students.


Since during my own search for housing I got annoyed of constantly wasting time by clicking on promising announcements only to see dreaded phrases such as "No students allowed", I decided to create a website that could help students save up time by filtering out the offers that are not for students.
